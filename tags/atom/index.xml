      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently switched to Atom from Sublime Text for web development. The transition was relatively painless since many of the keyboard shortcuts and capabilities are the same in. I really enjoy usig Atom and want to have that same experience with programming in Go. This documents my Go setup in Atom.
Install and Configuration Steps   Install go-plus
  Set the go-plus GOPATH setting
 Ideally the Atom application process should have GOPATH in its ENV and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to set this.</description>

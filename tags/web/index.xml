<title>Hosting Static Sites on Heroku</title>

&lt;p&gt;I was recently creating a web site for a family member, and was looking around for the best place to host it.  It&amp;rsquo;s a simple personal site that only contains static content.  There are many options out there from the freebie wordpress options to rackspace and the like.  None of the &amp;ldquo;web publishing platform&amp;rdquo; type sites were a fit because I wanted full control over the layout, and look and feel of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with &lt;a href=&#34;http://heroku.com&#34;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt; for my day job for web applications, and it&amp;rsquo;s been simple to get things up and running at no cost.  Heroku allows you to create a web application for free, and only if you need to scale to support the traffic do you have to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the limitations of using the free plan with heroku is that if your app hasn&amp;rsquo;t recieved any traffic within an hour, it puts it into an idle state.  They call this &lt;a href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos&#34;&gt;dyno idling&lt;/a&gt;  and when a request comes in and your dyno is in an idle state, it has to spin it back up, and that takes time.  In my experience, I&amp;rsquo;ll go to hit the site and it takes approx. 5 seconds to respond.  It&amp;rsquo;s free, so I can understand when they do this to save on compute resources, and if you have pay / have multiple dynos, they never with idle your app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work around this you just need to have at least 1 request come in an hour.  There are many ways to do this, and I took the simple approach of using a monitoring service (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pingdom.com/&#34;&gt;pingdom&lt;/a&gt;) to check/ping the site for availability every 5 minutes.  You could also implement by using a background worker process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thereâ€™s a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/static-sites-ruby&#34;&gt;Creating Static Sites in Ruby with Rack&lt;/a&gt; walkthrough on the heroku dev center that will have you up and running in few minutes. They provide a fully functional &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/leereilly/static-site-heroku-cedar-example&#34;&gt;sample application&lt;/a&gt; that you can modify to make you own.&lt;/p&gt;

      I was recently creating a web site for a family member, and was looking around for the best place to host it. It&rsquo;s a simple personal site that only contains static content. There are many options out there from the freebie wordpress options to rackspace and the like. None of the &ldquo;web publishing platform&rdquo; type sites were a fit because I wanted full control over the layout, and look and feel of the site.

      I&rsquo;ve been working on a web app that targets both smartphones and tablets. The large variation in screen sizes has sent me down the path of using a dynamic proportional layout that adapts to fit the available space. For example, I&rsquo;ve allocated 20% of the available vertical space to the header section that displays a title. The jQuery UI.Layout Plug-in has worked great for laying out the content areas, but I ran into a wall when it came to sizing my text proportionately.

      There are many choices for notes apps out in the App Store. So many that it&rsquo;d be a couple days effort just to look into and evaluate them all. Everything from the built-in simple Notes app to the feature packed Evernote. A notes app is one of those utility apps that gets a lot of mileage like mail and weather.

The toolchain and the way you use the various components matches the rails development process. Open your favorite text editor and a terminal, and you&rsquo;re ready to go.

      I was recently creating a web site for a family member, and was looking around for the best place to host it. It&rsquo;s a simple personal site that only contains static content. There are many options out there from the freebie wordpress options to rackspace and the like. None of the &ldquo;web publishing platform&rdquo; type sites were a fit because I wanted full control over the layout, and look and feel of the site.

      I&rsquo;ve been digesting all the new information around Windows 8 and Metro over the past week. I&rsquo;ve watched the BUILD Conference Channel 9 Videos, read the articles and docs on the Windows Dev Center and the Building Windows 8 blog. The best resource for your time on learning what Metro is all about from a design perspective is 8 traits of great Metro style apps.
The Metro Style interface is a totally new and original approach to UI.

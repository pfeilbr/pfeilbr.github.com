      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently switched to Atom from Sublime Text for web development. The transition was relatively painless since many of the keyboard shortcuts and capabilities are the same in. I really enjoy usig Atom and want to have that same experience with programming in Go. This documents my Go setup in Atom.
Install and Configuration Steps   Install go-plus
  Set the go-plus GOPATH setting
 Ideally the Atom application process should have GOPATH in its ENV and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to set this.</description>

      <description>Go has been getting a lot of traction among the coding elite due to it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity, speed, and most touted, it&amp;rsquo;s ability to enable concurrent solutions.
Go is a very small language. If you have experience with a few languages, you can learn in a few days and fit and keep it all in your head. With most other languages, I&amp;rsquo;m accustomed to looking up documentation or examples on stackoverflow while I code.</description>

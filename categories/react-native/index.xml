      <description>React Native was released as open source yesterday. There&amp;rsquo;s been quite a bit of build up and excitement since the React.js Conf 2015 video. The video showed a real app being built with a web development style workflow (your favorite editor with livereload). I&amp;rsquo;ve built some apps using React.js and really appreciate the simplicity and development workflow. Having the same for native app development definitely is exciting. I&amp;rsquo;ve gottent to spend a few hours with it and it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s living up to the hype.</description>

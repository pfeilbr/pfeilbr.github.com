<h2 id="ios-enterprise-app-store">iOS Enterprise App Store</h2>
<p>Enterprises that are members of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/enterprise/">iOS Developer Enterpise Program</a> can distribute their employee apps with their own App Store using Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution/Introduction/Introduction.html">over-the-air distribution</a>.  With this solution, you just drop your app .ipa file and a file with information about the app into a directory, and it&rsquo;s immediately available for users to install.</p>
<p>The backend is a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> web app.  On the front-end there&rsquo;s a built-in <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> web interface, and also a separate native iPhone app.</p>

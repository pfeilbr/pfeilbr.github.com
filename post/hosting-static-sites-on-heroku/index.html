<p>I was recently creating a web site for a family member, and was looking around for the best place to host it.  It&rsquo;s a simple personal site that only contains static content.  There are many options out there from the freebie wordpress options to rackspace and the like.  None of the &ldquo;web publishing platform&rdquo; type sites were a fit because I wanted full control over the layout, and look and feel of the site.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> for my day job for web applications, and it&rsquo;s been simple to get things up and running at no cost.  Heroku allows you to create a web application for free, and only if you need to scale to support the traffic do you have to pay.</p>
<p>One of the limitations of using the free plan with heroku is that if your app hasn&rsquo;t recieved any traffic within an hour, it puts it into an idle state.  They call this <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos">dyno idling</a>  and when a request comes in and your dyno is in an idle state, it has to spin it back up, and that takes time.  In my experience, I&rsquo;ll go to hit the site and it takes approx. 5 seconds to respond.  It&rsquo;s free, so I can understand when they do this to save on compute resources, and if you have pay / have multiple dynos, they never with idle your app.</p>
<p>To work around this you just need to have at least 1 request come in an hour.  There are many ways to do this, and I took the simple approach of using a monitoring service (<a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">pingdom</a>) to check/ping the site for availability every 5 minutes.  You could also implement by using a background worker process.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s a great <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/static-sites-ruby">Creating Static Sites in Ruby with Rack</a> walkthrough on the heroku dev center that will have you up and running in few minutes. They provide a fully functional <a href="https://github.com/leereilly/static-site-heroku-cedar-example">sample application</a> that you can modify to make you own.</p>

<p>There are many choices for notes apps out in the App Store.  So many that it&rsquo;d be a couple days effort just to look into and evaluate them all.  Everything from the built-in simple Notes app to the feature packed <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>.  A notes app is one of those utility apps that gets a lot of mileage like mail and weather.  Something with high usage you want the most efficient and streamlined app.  It&rsquo;s also something that becomes personal and people get attached to.</p>
<p>I wanted something extremely simple, clean up, and fast.  I started with the simplest possible solution of a single <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITextView_Class/Reference/UITextView.html">text view</a> you could type in.  From that, the ability to create multiple notes was added, but I didn&rsquo;t want the freedom to create as many notes as you want.  Having constraints on the number of notes forces the user to create more meaningful notes and manage / clean up notes.  The goal with minotes is not to have an archive of all historical notes with search, etc.  The type of notes appropriate for this app are short-lived ones and in general have a lifespan of around a week.  I landed on a UI metaphore similar to mobile safari with a max of 9 notes.</p>
<p>Preferences around typography and text size is something that is really needed in order to be useful for more than a specific set of users.  For example, older people may need a little bit larger font size, whearas younger users may want to cram more text on the screen and are fine with a smaller font size.  In order to keep it simple, there are three typefaces to choose from and in sizes, small, medium, large.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an opinionated app built with my specific needs in mind.  It&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t try to appeal to all users univerally, but if you like simple purpose built apps, check it out.</p>

<p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> was released as open source yesterday.  There&rsquo;s been quite a bit of build up and excitement since the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rDsRXj9-cU">React.js Conf 2015 video</a>.  The video showed a <strong>real</strong> app being built with a web development style workflow (your favorite editor with livereload).  I&rsquo;ve built some apps using <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a> and really appreciate the simplicity and development workflow.  Having the same for native app development definitely is exciting.  I&rsquo;ve gottent to spend a few hours with it and it looks like it&rsquo;s living up to the hype.</p>
<p>I started in with the <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html#content">tutorial</a>, which is a movies app backed by <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> data.  The main UI is a run of the mill <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/listview.html#content">List View</a> with each cell containing a poster image, and the movie title and year.</p>
<p>It shows fetching data over the network, some of the concerns with rendering list views, and the react core concept of only re-rendering thing that&rsquo;ve changes with <code>ListView.DataSource.rowHasChanged</code>.</p>
<p>They sprinkle in <a href="https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features">ES6</a> syntax within the examples, and some of it I had to look up.  This is a good way to give people a gentle introduction to it.  I can see how it might be a bit distracting if your trying to learn something new.  Having to learn language level features on top of a new framework could be offputting for some.</p>
<h2 id="yep-its-all-in-that-single-file">Yep. It&rsquo;s All in that single file.</h2>
<p>It does a good job with starting off with a single minimal view and layering on the different concepts to get you to some more than <code>hello world</code>, but not a <strong>real</strong> app.  One of the things that stood out to me and made it much easier to follow is that all the code is in a single file.  UI, style, logic, and data.  This is huge from a learning and user uptake perspective.  For larger apps, it will get cumbersome quickly and using separate <code>.js</code> files and <code>require</code> them in will make it managaeble.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen way too much time spent in other javascript frameworks first introducing the <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/angularjs-best-practices-directory-structure">file and directory layout</a>.  There are as many different ways to lay things out as there are javascript frameworks these days.  I agree it&rsquo;s important for maintainability and collaboration, but when starting out, I feel it should be kept simple, and only restructure when needed.  Choice is good, but I hope facebook explicitly documents their recommended layout and people just use it.</p>
<h2 id="native-modules-call-for-community-contributions">Native Modules: Call for Community Contributions</h2>
<p>If react native doesn&rsquo;t provide the UI component or capability you need, they allow extension via <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/nativemodulesios.html#content">Native Modules</a>.  Bridging is never pretty as it always feels like you need to switch contexts and be aware this is a <code>bridge component</code>.  They do their best to minimize this and in the spirit of react it&rsquo;s lightweight and only requires the minimal amount of hooks to do it&rsquo;s job.</p>
<p>You only need to implement the <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/nativemodulesios.html#ios-calendar-module-example">RCTBridgeModule</a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithProtocols/WorkingwithProtocols.html">protocol</a> to expose native code.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/nativemodulesios.html#content">example</a></p>
<pre><code>// CalendarManager.h
#import &quot;RCTBridgeModule.h&quot;

@interface CalendarManager : NSObject &lt;RCTBridgeModule&gt;
@end

// CalendarManager.m
@implementation CalendarManager

- (void)addEventWithName:(NSString *)name location:(NSString *)location
{
  RCT_EXPORT();
  RCTLogInfo(@&quot;Pretending to create an event %@ at %@&quot;, name, location);
}

@end

var CalendarManager = require('NativeModules').CalendarManager;
CalendarManager.addEventWithName('Birthday Party', '4 Privet Drive, Surrey');
</code></pre><p>As you can see, it&rsquo;s minimally intrusive on both the objc and js sides.</p>
<p>Native Modules is the community aspect of this effort and if done right will give it staying power.  The productivity and developer workflow benefits of <code>npm install awesomesauce</code> is the one of the core underlying reasons for javascript/node popularity.</p>
<p>A decision needs to be made on whether <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> or a native packager like <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">Cocoapods</a> will be the vehicle for packaging and distributing native modules.  To keep it x-platform and support android, npm would be the obvious choice.  It&rsquo;s important for the react native team to make a decision on this and define this from the start.  People will fill the gaps that react native doesn&rsquo;t include. The easier you make it for them to publish for community, the better off the ecosystem will be.</p>
<h2 id="fetchhttpsfetchspecwhatwgorg"><a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">Fetch</a></h2>
<p>Networking and more specifically the ability to fetch HTTP resources is a core capability of a majority of applications today.  While walking through the tutorial I saw the use of <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network.html#content">fetch</a>, but had never seen it before.  I thought it was something that facebook defined and injected that bridged into iOS&rsquo;s networking.  It does this, but in addition it&rsquo;s based on the <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">fetch networking API</a>, which is going through the standard process.  Hopefully a higher profile project like react native will give it some legs.</p>
<h2 id="onward">Onward</h2>
<p>Native development on the native target platform will always be more popular.  It doesn&rsquo;t strive to or need to try to supplant native development.  Capturing the web development community alone is a huge audience.  More importantly, the react community is full of super star developers that will acively champion things they like.  If it reached the success of a <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a> and as large a community, it would be quite an achievement.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s early and if you don&rsquo;t have a lot free time or care to be on the bleeding edge, I&rsquo;d recommend waiting a bit before using it to develop a production app.  As with anything new and in interest of the long-term goals, I&rsquo;m sure there will be bugs to work through, breaking changes, API changes, additional development and debugging tooling, etc.</p>
<p>Even if I don&rsquo;t dive right in, at a minimum I&rsquo;ll keep up with it&rsquo;s progress via rss feeds and twitter.  Kudos to the react native team for a great launch and wish them the best.</p>

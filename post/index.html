      I&rsquo;ve recently switched to Atom from Sublime Text for web development. The transition was relatively painless since many of the keyboard shortcuts and capabilities are the same in. I really enjoy usig Atom and want to have that same experience with programming in Go. This documents my Go setup in Atom.
Install and Configuration Steps   Install go-plus
  Set the go-plus GOPATH setting
 Ideally the Atom application process should have GOPATH in its ENV and you shouldn&rsquo;t have to set this.

      React Native was released as open source yesterday. There&rsquo;s been quite a bit of build up and excitement since the React.js Conf 2015 video. The video showed a real app being built with a web development style workflow (your favorite editor with livereload). I&rsquo;ve built some apps using React.js and really appreciate the simplicity and development workflow. Having the same for native app development definitely is exciting. I&rsquo;ve gottent to spend a few hours with it and it looks like it&rsquo;s living up to the hype.

      Go has been getting a lot of traction among the coding elite due to it&rsquo;s simplicity, speed, and most touted, it&rsquo;s ability to enable concurrent solutions.
Go is a very small language. If you have experience with a few languages, you can learn in a few days and fit and keep it all in your head. With most other languages, I&rsquo;m accustomed to looking up documentation or examples on stackoverflow while I code.

There&rsquo;s a rich developer ecosystem around web apps built with popular web frameworks such as Rails, Django, Express, Symfony, etc. All of these frameworks assume a relational database as a backend, which because of it&rsquo;s age, usage, and rich set of existing toolsets, makes it easy to get started with.

      There are many choices for notes apps out in the App Store. So many that it&rsquo;d be a couple days effort just to look into and evaluate them all. Everything from the built-in simple Notes app to the feature packed Evernote. A notes app is one of those utility apps that gets a lot of mileage like mail and weather. Something with high usage you want the most efficient and streamlined app.

      I was recently creating a web site for a family member, and was looking around for the best place to host it. It&rsquo;s a simple personal site that only contains static content. There are many options out there from the freebie wordpress options to rackspace and the like. None of the &ldquo;web publishing platform&rdquo; type sites were a fit because I wanted full control over the layout, and look and feel of the site.

      RubyMotion is a toolchain that lets you develop iOS using Ruby. I&rsquo;m a big fan of Ruby and have been using it on and off since 2001. It&rsquo;s been a huge timesaver in many cases allowing me to quickly script solutions. When I heard it was coming to iOS I had to check it out.
The toolchain and the way you use the various components matches the rails development process. Open your favorite text editor and a terminal, and you&rsquo;re ready to go.
